# D OpenSLES Interface

This project is meant to bring an easier way to use OpenSLES on the D language.

OpenSLES miss too much documentation and it just doesn't have enough support.
This repo brings 2 important points about OpenSLES:

1. An interface for easier usage
2. FFMpeg build automation for android architectures, on Windows, it even handles installing msys2 for the usage
